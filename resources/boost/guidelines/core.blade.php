## Vendra Subscription

The `misaf/vendra-subscription` package is a **generic, subscriber-agnostic subscription engine**: it owns **plans** and **subscriptions** and their lifecycle primitives, and nothing else. It does NOT know about resellers, tenants, properties, users, or provisioning — those live in the host app, which is the sole consumer.

### Standards

### Translatable Persistence

- Making a persisted model field translatable is an explicit domain choice unless this package already requires it.
- Every field listed in a model's `$translatable` array must definitely use a JSON database column. Keep its model traits/casts, factories, validation, Filament locale UI, API serialization, and tests translation-aware.
- A field not listed in `$translatable` must use the appropriate scalar database type and must not use Spatie Translatable, translatable slug traits, locale switchers, translated callbacks, or translation-shaped array data.

### Vendra Transitive API Policy

- Treat a Vendra dependency intentionally exposed through the public API of a directly required Vendra platform package as part of the supported public contract of that package.
- Do not add a redundant direct Composer requirement solely because source code imports a type from that exposed dependency.
- Apply this only to Vendra platform packages listed under `require`; never extend it to `require-dev`, `suggest`, incidental implementation dependencies, or third-party packages. Removing or replacing an exposed dependency is a breaking change; keep `self.version` alignment across the Vendra package graph.

- Keep subscription code inside `packages/vendra-subscription` using the `Misaf\VendraSubscription` namespace.
- This package owns `Models\{Plan,Subscription,SubscriptionPayment}`, `Enums\{PeriodUnit,SubscriptionStatus,SubscriptionPaymentStatus}`, `Exceptions\{PlanInUseException,SubscriptionPaymentException}`, and `SubscriptionServiceProvider`. Concrete plan data (`PlanSeeder`) is the host app's business config and lives in the app, not here. Depend only on `misaf/vendra-support` (for `ShouldLogActivity`) and framework/Spatie packages — never on a domain provider such as `misaf/vendra-tenant`, `misaf/vendra-user`, or `misaf/vendra-permission`.
- **Subscriber decoupling:** `Subscription::subscriber()` is a generic `MorphTo` over `subscriber_type` / `subscriber_id`; the package never imports a concrete subscriber. Owning models define the inverse `morphMany`. Each host registers a stable morph alias for every subscriber model and migrates pre-alias FQCN values before using the alias. `SubscriptionFactory::forSubscriber($model)` stores the model's morph class, while a bare ID uses its explicit generic default type. The `(subscriber_type, active_subscriber_guard)` unique index enforces one active subscription per subscriber.
- `Subscription` provides generic lifecycle behavior only: scopes (`active`, `lapsed`, `expiringWithin`), `isActive()`/`isOnTrial()`/`suspendAt()`, price/currency snapshot columns, trial + grace fields. Reseller-specific orchestration (subscribe/charge/enforce/quota) lives in the host app.
- `Plan` owns pricing (`price`/`currency_code`), `trial_days`, `grace_days`, a JSON `features` array (`Plan::allows()`), and a `max_units` limit (an opaque cap the app interprets). Deleting an in-use plan throws `PlanInUseException`.
- `SubscriptionPayment` is the durable provider-neutral collection record. Persist its provider, amount, currency, immutable idempotency key, provider reference, lifecycle status, attempts, sanitized failure details, and recovery timestamps before contacting a provider. Never treat a pending provider or Vendra transaction as paid.
- Treat `SubscriptionCharge::reference` as a required idempotency key. `SubscriptionCharger::charge()` and `retrieve()` return a typed lifecycle result. Repeated calls with the same reference and financial payload must resolve to the same provider operation without collecting twice; providers must reject reuse for different details.
- Paid subscriptions remain `PendingPayment` until the durable payment is `Paid`. Network I/O, retries, recovery, provider webhooks, and subscriber activation/provisioning live in the host app and must run outside database transactions and row locks.
- Plan/Subscription implement `Misaf\VendraSupport\Contracts\ShouldLogActivity` (marker only). New plan/subscription columns must be reflected in the root `database/migrations` baseline byte-identically to the package `.stub` (enforced by `FreshDatabaseSchemaTest`, which also forbids `add_/rename_` follow-up migrations); cross-table references use plain indexed columns, no DB foreign keys.
- Follow Laravel comment style: document with PHPDoc (array shapes, generics, `@see`) and reserve inline comments for genuinely complex logic.
- Keep tests purposeful: cover plan pricing/entitlements and subscription scopes/state transitions — not framework internals or the app's reseller orchestration.
- Keep Pest architecture tests in `tests/ArchTest.php`: the `php`, `security`, and `laravel` presets, plus `not->toUse` for every domain provider (including `Misaf\VendraTenant`, `Misaf\VendraUser`, `Misaf\VendraPermission`) — the engine must stay subscriber-agnostic.
