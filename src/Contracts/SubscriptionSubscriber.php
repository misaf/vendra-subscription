 * A billing entity that can hold plan-limited subscriptions. Subscriptions are
 * polymorphic; this contract lets the subscription engine (subscribe, activate,
 * enforce) operate on any subscriber without knowing the concrete model. The
 * host app currently implements it on Misaf\VendraReseller\Models\Reseller, but a future
 * subscriber only needs to implement this interface and register in the morph
 * map.
 *
 * The contract exposes subscription operations rather than the raw Eloquent
 * relation so the engine stays free of ORM details. Implementations are Eloquent
 * models; type against Model&SubscriptionSubscriber where model behaviour (e.g.
 * getKey) is also required.
